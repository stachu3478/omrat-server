# Optical Music Recognition Annotation Tool - Server pack

Steps to run this project:

1. Run `npm i` command
2. Setup database settings inside `ormconfig.json` file
3. Run `npm start` 

The repository is not very useful on its own. However it can be used to receive requests from OMRAT client to do various stuff like automatic annotation or managing annotations or users. Annotation management and automatic annotation request handlers need to be implemented.
